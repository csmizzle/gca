Wind and solar power grew to a record share of 12% of power generation, again surpassing nuclear, which fell 4.4%, and meeting 84% of net electricity demand growth.Coal\\'s share in power generation remained dominant at around 35.4%.[1/4]Smoke and steam billow from Belchatow Power Station, Europe\\'s largest coal-fired power plant powered by lignite, in Zlobnica, Poland October 20, 2022. REUTERS/Kuba StezyckiOILOil consumption increased by 2.9 million barrels per day (bpd) to 97.3 million bpd, with growth slowing compared with the previous year.Compared with pre-Covid levels in 2019, oil consumption was 0.7% lower.Most oil demand growth came from revived appetite for jet fuel and diesel-related products.Oil production grew by 3.8 million bpd, with the lion\\'s share coming from OPEC members and the United States. Nigeria saw the largest decline.Oil refining capacity grew by 534,000 bpd, mainly in non-OECD countries.NATURAL GASAmid record prices in Europe and Asia, global gas demand fell 3% but still made up 24% of primary energy consumption, slightly below the previous year.Gas production was stable year-on-year.Liquefied natural gas (LNG) production was up 5% at 542 billion cubic metres (bcm), a similar pace to the previous year, with most growth coming from North America and the Asia-Pacific region.Europe accounted for much of LNG demand growth, increasing its imports by 57%, while countries in the Asia-Pacific region and South and Central America reduced purchases.Japan replaced China as the world\\'s largest LNG importer.COALCoal prices hit record levels, rising 145% in Europe and 45% in Japan.Coal consumption rose 0.6%, its highest level since 2014, driven mainly by Chinese and Indian demand, while consumption in North America and Europe declined.Coal output was 7% higher than the previous year, with China, India and Indonesia accounting for most of the growth.RENEWABLESGrowth in renewable power, excluding hydro-power, slowed down slightly to 14% but solar and wind capacity still showed a record increase of 266 gigawatts, with solar taking the lion\\'s share.China added the most solar and wind power.EMISSIONSGlobal energy-related emissions, including industrial processes and flaring, were up 0.8% reaching a new high of 39.3 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent.MINERALSLithium carbonate prices jumped 335%.
